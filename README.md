# DAH-Project-C-Synthesiser
Synthesizer.py contains all of the code necessary for the synthesiser. load_sounds.py is the code used to load in each of the notes
and save them as .wavfiles.
The raspberry pi's in the lab do not have the wavio module by default - run the following in the terminal to install it: pip install wavio
